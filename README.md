Introduction
----------
FlymTV is a fork of [Flym](https://github.com/FredJul/Flym) by [Frédéric Julian](https://github.com/FredJul). I maintain and support Android TV format for this app.

Note
----------
 - I start this project mainly for educational purpose.
 - This app uses RSS to display news.
 - Some app's elements are translated into vietnamese. You're free to modify strings.xml for translations to your liking.
 - I put my face on home screen (for fun :v). You're free to change this action_settings.png image.
 - Always enable "Đọc tiếp ngay trong ứng dụng này" in Edit feed section to load high-resolution images on homescreen.
 - The more feed sources you add, the more internet speed and time you'll need to properly display all the news on homescreen.
 - To reinstall this app, first uninstall this app.
 - You can change minSdk to API 15.
 - The app icon is of [VnExpress.net](https://vnexpress.net) website. Do respect the owner of this logo and contact me if there're any problems or copyright issues.
 - Respect my work and give credit to me when mentioning about FlymTV (mostly for its Android TV UI support).
 - Press "Watch" or "Star" this repository to support my development.
 
Recommended settings for maximum usability
----------
 - Enable automatic refresh: ON
 - Refresh interval: 30 minutes
 - Refresh feeds on open: ON
 - Refresh only over Wi-Fi: OFF
 - Light theme: ON
 - Time that the entries will be kept: 4 days
 - Text size: +1
 - Display images: ON
 - Preload images: Always
 - Entries order: OFF
 - Auto-fullscreen entries: OFF
 - Enable notifications: ON
 - Ringtone: None
 - Vibrate: OFF
 - Light: OFF
 - You should install this app on your phone. Then create feed sources, export to OPML and import this OPML file when installing it on TV, because adding and organizing feed sources on Android TV is hard/buggy, etc.

Existing bugs
----------
 - Cannot play videos fetched on Android TV.
 - Few redundant elements may be fetched from some feed sources, websites, etc.
 - Hard to configure feed source on Android TV.
